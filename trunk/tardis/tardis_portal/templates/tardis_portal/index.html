		<b>xTARDIS</b> is based on <b>MyTARDIS</b>, a multi-institutional collaborative venture that facilitates the archiving and sharing of data and metadata collected at major facilities such as the Australian Synchrotron and ANSTO and within several institutions.
	</p>
    <p>
        xTARDIS is developed by the <a href="www.unisa.edu.au">University of South Australia</a> through funding provided by <a href="ands.org.au">ANDS</a>. It endevours to extend the core of MyTARDIS, and enable a simple, easy to use data and meta-data repository for a wider range of research institutions. Priorities are:
        <ul>
            <li>RIF-CS harvesting via OAI-PMH for the <a href="http://services.ands.org.au/home/orca/rda/index.php">Research Data Australia database</a>.</li>
            <li>Automatic meta-data extraction from experiments.</li>
            <li>Centralised storage of all raw experiment data to facilitate automated backup and recovery.</li>
            <li>Ease of use for researchers and administrators.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
	<!--<p>
		An example of the benefit of a system such as MyTARDIS in the protein crystallography community is that while the model coordinates and (less often) the structure factors (processed experimental data) are stored in the community Protein Data Bank (PDB) the raw diffraction data is often not available. There are several reasons why this is important, which can be summarised as:
		<ul>
			<li>
		The availability of raw data is extremely useful for the development of improved methods of image analysis and data processing.
			</li>
			<li>
		Fostering the archival of raw data at an institutional level is one the best ways of ensuring that this data is not lost (laboratory archives are typically volatile).
			</li>
		</ul>
